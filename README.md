We’re building the digital version of you and your friends going out to lunch: just your table, your conversation, no one else invited and no one else watching.

Even as a simple web app — no notifications, no reminders, built-in friction — 40 early users kept coming back. No growth tricks. Just something people chose to return to. SOMETHING POEPLE WANTED!

We’re now in the process of being approved on the Apple App Store.
